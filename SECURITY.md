   to submit your report.

## Security Measures

This project uses automated security scanning:

- **Bandit** — static analysis for common security issues in Python
- **Secret scanning** — detection of hardcoded API keys, tokens, and passwords
- **pip-audit** — dependency vulnerability scanning against the PyPI advisory database
- **CodeQL** — GitHub's semantic code analysis engine

## Scope

This policy applies to the latest release and the main development branch.
Older versions receive security patches on a best-effort basis.
